@0    = ~What?! You galley-whipped short-knickers! Tiax the grand will not stand to be cast aside! He shall ascend without your bumbling sneakery! The Great Tiax, betrayed on all sides by those seeking to undermine his coming rule, casts aside the refuse he once called his slaves! Mindless fools! Breathe deep and fill your ill-fated lungs with the salty airs of your sorry destiny!~
@1    = ~Yes, yes, the all-seeing Tiax thinks that his leaving would be best. He must finalize his stratagems and consult in secret with Cyric. You shall, of course, meet the Great Tiax again, at which point I will make my grand ascension and appoint you to your rightful place as whipper of the slaves and faithless.~
@2    = ~Never mind. Join me again.~
@3    = ~Return to the Government district, Tiax. We will meet you there.~ 
@4    = ~Yes, just wait here.~
@5    = ~Have you come to your senses and decided to have Tiax join your motley group?~
@6    = ~Yes, of course, Tiax. How can we fare without you?~
@7    = ~Not yet, I'm afraid.~
@8    = ~As was foretold at the beginning of all, so the wayward brainless children have returned to the bosom of their intended celestial nanny. I, Tiax, welcome you back to your eternal glorious servitude.~
@9    = ~It would seem you are not truly ready to accept your roles as the eternal steppingstone of Tiax the ponderous. It is of little concern. In time you will realize your place. Tiax will wait.~
