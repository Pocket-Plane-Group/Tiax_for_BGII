1. Introduction
----------------

Tiax NPC MOD for Baldur's Gate II (Tiax for short) is an add-on for the game
Baldur's Gate II, with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.
Throne of Bhaal content is present.

Tiax, a non-player character from the first game in Baldur's Gate series, is a
gnome thief/cleric, a priest of Cyric with a sole goal in mind: world
domination. Notable quotes: "Tiax rules all!"

----------------
2. Installation

Mac OS X:

-----------------------
3. General Information
-----------------------

Tiax is available to join the party in Chapter 4. He has no items, so it is
advisable to secure some for him in advance.

Tiax has a short "friendship" path with the PC, banters with every Bioware NPC,
a number of interjections, character reactions and other scenery dialogue.

Depending on PC' level in Chapter 4, Tiax' experience may equal to 400000, 
800000, 1200000, 1600000 or 2000000 experience points.

In ToB, Tiax starts with 2500000 experience. Once he reaches level 25 in his
cleric class, he receives the Holy Cymbol of Cyric.

If you experience any problems with Tiax's select/confirm sounds, select him
in the game and press K key. This should fix the problem.

4. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: Where is Tiax?
A: This answer contains spoilers.

Tiax spawns in Chapter 4, in Spellhold, right after Irenicus leaves it, 
and the inmates drop dead. He is also available from the Fate Spirit in the
Throne of Bhaal.

Q: But he is not there!
A: Make sure that you have actually installed the mod. Open your game directory
and run Setup-Tiax.exe. If this file is not there, repeat the installation
as described above.

Q: Tiax's select/confirm sounds are all mixed up!
A: Select Tiax and press K key.

Q: Everybody is saying the wrong lines!
A: Try starting a new game.
Q: It does not help!
A: Restore a clean installation, reinstall your mods, and start a new game.

Q: Tiax talks in SoA, but doesn't talk in ToB!
A: Open your game directory and run Setup-Tiax.exe. You will have to reload your
SoA save, though. 
Q: It does not help!
A: Restore a clean installation, reinstall your mods, and start a new game.

Q: Is Tiax compatible with mod X?
A: Tiax should work fine with other mods.
