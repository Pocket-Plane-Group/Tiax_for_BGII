# Tiax for BGII
An NPC mod for Baldur's Gate II (BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET)!

A comedy-evil gnome!

Banters with all the BG2 NPCs!

Survives Spellhold after all!

The world's first bilingual twenty-four hour NPC!

Tiax for BG2 is Kulyok's one-day interpretation of the dreaded gnomish spellslinger from BG1. No longer must Tiax fall to lesser talents in Spellhold--take him along for the rest of the game!
